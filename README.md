1. INTRODUCTION
A chatbot for universities is a computer software created to simulate conversations with student users, usually through text exchanges. Artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies are frequently used to power these chatbots, allowing them to understand and react to user inquiries like a human would. University chatbots can be utilised for a variety of tasks, such as assisting students, informing potential students about admissions, responding to questions from students about courses and academic programmes, and more. University chatbots are a widely used tool that helps colleges better serve their students, improve user experience, and increase engagement and communication with the university community.
